# Is Microsoft Going in the Wrong Direction with the Surface Laptop?

On May 2<sup>nd</sup>, Microsoft introduced the [Surface Laptop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-laptop/overview), its first traditional clamshell notebook,, to accompany the introduction of Windows 10S. And as expected from a Surface device, its aesthetic and build quality is top notch. The machine still retains the metal casing signature of the Surface line, but with more color option than any product before. Its screen is beautiful, the keyboard and touchpad is among the best. It is lighter than a Macbook Air while being as powerful as a Macbook Pro. The only real flaw with the product is the selection of ports (only one USB-A 3.0, instead of USB-C or Thunderbolt). Everything else borders on perfection.

And yet something does not seem right with the introduction of the laptop. Even after three weeks, I still have difficulty understanding Microsoft's strategy regarding the Surface Laptop with respect to Windows 10S and the Surface line as a whole.This is not a review of the machine in any way, rather a discussion of Microsoft's business reasons behind the Surface Laptop.

## Surface Laptop and Windows 10S

Windows 10S is the new version of Windows crafted specifically to battle the spread of Chromebooks. It's normal Windows 10 without the ability to install and run programs not from the Windows Store (think Windows RT). It is specifically marketed towards schools, boasting fast startup/shutdown, low resource requirement, and restricted access and easy maintenance, which are all quite desirable features for use in a pre-college education setting (and part of the reason why Chromebooks has been dominating in this sector).

Yet the Surface Laptop looks nothing like a product targeting middle school and high school students. It is expensive (lowest configuration of 128GB SSD and 4GB RAM is $999). It requires extreme care ([Microsoft official says that it should be treated as a luxurious product](https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/9/15587364/microsoft-surface-laptop-alcantara-fabric-cleaning)). Neither factor flies well with the school settings, in which multiple students, most with sweats, many with dirty hands of surgar and dirt, are going to use the machine.

Worse still, of all Surface devices, the Surface laptop seems to be the least appropriate for Windows 10S. Most of the apps in the Windows Store are touch-based, which means that touch will take a much bigger role in Windows 10S compared to the normal version of Windows 10. And while the Surface Laptop does have a touch screen, it lacks the ability to detach the screen and use it as a tablet that the Surface Pro and Surface Book have. Given that touch is still the most natural way to interact with a device, this seems like a glaring omission. Think about it: a clamshell notebook running Windows 10S is comparable to a Chromebook. *A convertible running 10S though, will take the best of both the Chromebook and the iPad*, and stand a much greater chance of succeeding in the education space.

It is quite obvious that the Surface Laptop is competing with the Macbooks for the college students market, not the Chromebooks. Introducing the Surface Laptop as the flagship Windows 10S device brings confusion and creates a feeling of being overpriced, especially after Windows 10 has been stressed for use as a locked-down, low-price computing platform. It simply feels like a mistake in advertising, a discord between the Windows team and the Surface team, *in which one is competing with Chromebooks and the other shooting for the Macbooks*. An updated [Surface Pro](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-pro/overview) (which was released only three weeks later, raising even more confusion as to why it was not released in the same event), or a resurrected 10-inch Surface, would be a much better fit for the platform.

## Surface Laptop in the Surface strategy

I love the Surface line. I love its attention to industrial design and its performance. But most importantly, I love the intention adn boldness coming fromthe family. It is the only hardware line whose main goal is not too make a profit (despite being a billion-dollar business on its own). The Surface line, first and foremost, exists to promote Windows' latest features, while forcing OEMs to work harder on manufacturing quality hardware to break Apple's dominance in the high end market. And it has pretty much achieved the goal: the emergence of the XPS-es, HP Spectres, Lenovo Yogas, or Asus Zenbooks, along with countless experiments in form factor and features from other OEMs in recent years has proved the impact of the Surface on the whole market. Heck, [even Apple is copying Microsoft nowadays, right down to the keyboard and the pen](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/).

This nature of the Surface line creates three interesting consequences. First, the Surface becomes a test bed for the next breakthrough in hardware design, leading the way for the whole industry (in other words, Microsoft invests and fails so that its partners do not have to). Second, the Surface integrates *__really really well__* with the newest feature of Windows: as innovative as the Surface Pro's detachable screen and the iconic kickstand are, or the Surface Studio's ability to have its screen lying almost flat on the desk, these features only make sense in the context of Microsoft's relentless push for touch, and later pen support, on the desktop. The Surface line also blurs the line between different categories, [effectively creating a category of its own](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/03/2-in-1s-are-driving-australian-tablet-sales/), and heading the way for a future of highly flexible devices, a future in which there is not distinction between a laptop and a tablet, and a desktop could double as a drawing board when necessary.

*The Surface Laptop is none of that though*.

It is a very well-packaged laptop, with a nice screen, a nice keyboard, and a nice touchpad. It is not detachable, like a Surface Pro, or convertible like a Yoga. It does not have any weird party trick, no huge risks taken, instead falling in line with the XPSes and the Macbooks. And since it does not offer anything that other laptop lacks, it does not feel integrated with Windows, the same way the Surface Pro or Surface Book is. For the first time, a Surface device does not push the boundary in hardware design or blur the line between different category. In fact, if we replace the Microsoft logo with one from Dell or Asus, I don't think anyone would notice.

Worse still, the introduction of the Surface Laptop has made the Surface line unnecessary complicated. It seems to serve roughly the same function as a Surface Book: a Surface laptop, albeit one without a detachable screen and optional dedicated graphic card; yet it is priced dangerously close to a Surface Pro ([$400 cheaper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-laptop/overview#surfaceconfiguration) than a [similarly configured Surface Book](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/d/Surface-Book/8TXJ08Q9LXDT/GXPZ?VID=5072761500) with Core i5, 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD). For possibly the first time, there are [confusions](https://www.windowscentral.com/should-you-buy-surface-pro-or-surface-laptop) in [which Surface](http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/laptop/microsoft-surface-pro-vs-surface-laptop-vs-surface-book-vs-surface-studio-3659482/) [one should purchase](http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/141169-which-microsoft-surface-device-is-best-for-you-surface-pro-surface-laptop-surface-book-or-surface-studio).

The problem is exacerbated when we remember that Microsoft is not in the hardware game to make money. For Apple, it does not matter whether customers are purchasing the Macbook Air or Macbook Pro; the money still flows into its pocket. For Microsoft though, **the Surface is a demonstration of its future vision**, and a confusion in which device to purchase impact directly on the perception of Microsoft's future direction. For years they have been talking about how hybrids would be the future of computing, and have the Surface Pro to back it up. But now with the Surface Laptop, are the retreating their statements? This will affect negatively to its OEMs as well, as they might back down on producing 2-in-1s, and *Windows will lose its biggest advantage against the Mac: the ability to change the interaction mode seamlessly*.

## Is the Surface Laptop the right device for Microsoft?

Now, I'm definitely not smarter than the army of hardware designers and engineers and managers and marketeers the Microsoft employs, so there might be a bigger endgame that I fail to recognize here. But then you could say that Microsoft has failed to sell me the grand idea, if it has any.

A trip around the web tells me that this might be the product with [the most mixed reception since the Surface Pro 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/68u3pa/the_surface_laptop_is_a_disappointment/) (not totally negative feedback, mind you, it is still a quality device that could compete with the best of Macbooks and XPSes). I'm hoping that Microsoft will elaborate more on its plan with the Surface Laptop and how it integrates with its Windows 10S and its Surface strategy as a whole. We really need Microsoft to step up its hardware design game when [Apple has all but](http://www.cultofmac.com/459403/apple-disappointments-2016/) [dropped the ball on it](https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13548052/the-macbook-pro-lie).
