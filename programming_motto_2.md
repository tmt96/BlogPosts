# KISS Principle: Keep it Simple Stupid

The idea behind KISS is that the simpler a program, a better it will run. This is due to less moving target to maintain, less unneeded complexity, and a more focused code base.

Arch Linux is a big proponent for this principle. By default, it only provides the bare-bone for the system: the kernel, foundational libraries and tools from GNU, a package manager, and... that's it. Users are expected to set up the environment themselves, including configuration, other tools, GUI, among others. Arch does not even have a "nice and easy" installer, so users could be easily lost in the sea of text stream from the setup process.

Is it KISS? Yes, in theory. The system contains only the bare minimum of a UNIX system. The code is generally clean. Yet something feels off. If you are the user, would you find Arch really simple? A typical setup process for Arch could take days between reading the wiki, asking help online and cursing at the computer.

The KISS principle was created in the early stage of computing, when most software are used in specialized and professional field. There, in most cases, consistency and stability are more important than user-friendliness. As we shift to a more consumer focused economy, user-friendliness would be the most important feature of any application.

PS: Here I also want to mention another cliche in computing, that is a program/webpage should have a simple ans sparse user interface. This is not strictly true. For any program or webpage succeeding with a simple user interface (Google Search page, early version of iOS) there are example of the other direction, programs succeeding with a heavy interface, providing all features users need at their fingertip (Microsoft Office, Adobe Suite, Facebook webpage). It is all about giving people the most convenient way to achieve what they need, whether with a simple or complex interface.
