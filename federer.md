# The greatest player* of all time has come out swinging

## Wimbledon 2016, Semifinal, set 5.

An unfamiliar sight occurs ion the Centre Court. Federer, the Greatest of All Time, 7-time champion, after an extended exchange against Raonic, falling face first into the grass. And not because of slippery grass (the grass in the second is usually very dry, and Federer definitely did not slip), or because of being wrong-footed by Raonic. Federer, already half the way to the ball, fell down, as if he was shot by a gun to his knee.

One thing non tennis fan should know: Federer does not simply just fall down. He is possibly the player with the best balance in the world. His feet glide and slide around the court, shuffling rapidly and effortlessly as the wing flap of a butterfly. Other players, like Nadal, Djokovic, or Murray, who rely on their physical ability and speed, who play a less sophisticated, more grinding style, may fall down, but not Federer. When Federer falls down, it's usually the case that he is mightily struggling against an opponent, as in his match against Wawrinka in Roland Garros 2015, as in his match that day against Raonic.

Federer went on to lose the match that day. And with his knees already damaged by an injury caught earlier in the season (while bathing his daughters!), Federer decided to pull out of the rest of the season, ending a disappointing campaign in which he only participated in 7 tournaments, and for the first time in 16 years, failed to win any title. He had failed to win a Grand Slam for the previous three years, and did not seem to have much chances left. The sun has set on SW19. The legend, 3 weeks from his 35th birthday, finally succumbed to age and the advance of the next generation.

## Wimbledon 2017, Final

Federer jumped up to celebrate his eighth Wimbledon and 19th Grand Slam. He has been the runaway best player of the year, winning two Grand Slams and two Masters, has a record of 31-2 for the year, and did not drop a set on his way to the title. The king is back, and his roar, at near 36 of age, is louder than ever.

And he did not just regain his old form. He improved on it. One only needs to look at his backhand. Pre-2017, it is one of the most beautiful shot in the world, the stroke so natural and effortless it almost looks like Jackson Pollock dripping paint on his drawing. It is also Roger's biggest weakness, one that constantly gets exploited by the Spanish topspin machine named Rafael Nadal, and crumbles at the most important moment.

But then in the final of Australian Open , something curious happened.
