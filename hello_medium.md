# Hello Medium

For the past half a year, I have contemplating starting a blog page, in the footstep of many other developers with pride in their work. The problem: I was lazy. And I hate myself for procrastinating. So now that my Facebook internship is only a month away, I figure that this would be a great time to force myself into actual work. It's also seems like a fun way to practice my mediocre writing skill, and to flush thoughts and ideas out of my head.

Of course, this blog/public personal journal would not be all about coding/technology. Here are a few possible topics that I would discuss:

- Programming, all different topics (tools, technology, fields, ...)
- Technology products (PCs, smartphones, softwares,...)
- Life as a programmers/college students/foreigner in the US
- Social issues
- Personal thoughts

Hopefully I could keep this reasonably updated. Remind me if you find any sign that the blog is getting abandoned. ANd have a good read.

PS: Also, if you happen to know my family, don't tell them about this blog. They seem to be afraid of all kind of online publication. The less they know, the better.
